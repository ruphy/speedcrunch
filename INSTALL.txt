Instruction to compile SpeedCrunch from source code

Requirements:
- CMake 2.4 or newer
- Qt 4.2 or newer

Steps:
- Create a sub-directory named 'build'
- Go to this sub-directory
- Run CMake like this:
    cmake ../src
- Then run make
    make
- To install, run (you might need administration priveleges)
    make install

NOTE: if you want to run SpeedCrunch translated in one of the supported
languages, you really need to perform the last step in order to install
the translation files (*.qm) to the directory where SpeedCrunch will look
at for them.
